									<h3>Basketball</h3>
									<p>From 2018-20, I played on the KW YBA House League Team where I was a 2019-20 Bantam D2 Finalist. In Grades 9 and 10, I was part of the highschool basketball team, where my team won the 2021-22 WCSSAA Championship.</p>

									<h3>Table Tennis</h3>
									<p>I attended Topspin Table Tennis from 2015-19, and am currently attending again from 2022. In 2019, I was nominated to be a representative of Canada for table tennis at the 2020 International Children Games being held in Hungary. Unfortunately, due to covid restrictions, I was unable to attend this tournament.</p>

									<h3>Leadership</h3>
									<p>My role as a leader is one that is consistently tested throughout all the volunteer and club experiences I have participated in. Specifically, the Believe Leadership Club I led in 2021-22 highlights my leadership experience, where, as a freshman, I lead people of all ages to create their own projects. In the end, our schoolâ€™s top team participated in the North American Collective Tournament and won first place with a $2000 grant!</p>
